# Persona Book | A Midterm Ouput

This repository contains the java file of my midterm output named PersonaBook. Persona book is a profile-record console app that stores names and ages only and is written in Java. This is my midterm output for the Subject Object-Oriented Programming(CIT-207) by Prof. John Rey Alipe. The task was to create an arraylist which has 2 fields for each person. The name and age. It should provide the functionalities such as to add an entry, delete an entry, view all entries, update an entry, and terminate the program.

## Persona Book Features

* Add an Entry
* Remove an Entry
* View All Entries
* Update an Entry
* Remove All Entries*
* Search an Entry*
* Terminate Program

*I've added 2 new functionalities that were not included as the requirements but will be useful for users.
